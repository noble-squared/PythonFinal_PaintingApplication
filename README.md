# Off-brand Painting Application

This was our final project for our Computer Science I class, Python Programming. It was a collaborative effort between Adara Noble ([@noble-squared](https://github.com/noble-squared)) and Tristan ([@n0din](https://github.com/n0din)), and was completed in Fall of 2023.             

## Description

This project is a painting application which can read your brushstrokes and produce lines on a canvas accordingly. Some features include:
* A user-sizable canvas (with a choice between presets, a random canvas size, and the user's own input)
* The ability to save your canvas as an array of pixels, then load it to continue where you left off
* A resizeable brush
* The ability to both erase and paint
* Multiple colors (selectable either by hexcode or name)
* An undo button

## Installing and Running the program

The program is contained inside of a single python file and uses only standard libraries. Therefore, the program can be run with any python IDE; however, the program was created and tested in Thonny, so I can only guarantee that IDE's effectiveness.
